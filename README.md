## FAQ

### What is this?

This is a fortune cookie corpus - a giant list of all fortunes from fortune cookies, started by @RichardLitt and @alvations.

### Why would you do this?

We are both computational linguists, and we enjoy fortune cookies for their weird idiosyncrasies, for their strange language, and especially when they are translated. We both started making our own corpora, and figured why not do it together.

### Can I add my fortune cookies?

Yes! All you need to do is make a user account on GitHub and add them in a Pull Request, or in an issue. Alternatively, feel free to email @RichardLitt with your cookies, and he'll add them himself. The more the merrier.

### What is my fortune?

We can make a random little script to tell you what your fortune is. TODO
